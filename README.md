Enigma Self-Assessment

Functionality - 4
Encrypt, decrypt, and cracking methods all working with CLI

OOP - 3
I included a module and tried to refactor and implement DRY as best I could, but there is still some repetition in a few methods and some of the method lengths are a little long

TDD - 4
I tried to make sure I was testing everything I needed to at the unit and integration level, test coverage is at 100%

Version Control - 3
I had over 40 commits but less than 15 pull requests. I tried to commit frequently, but I still wasn't committing in small enough chunks at the beginning of the project. I increased my commit frequency as I progressed through the project.
